# Introduction 
You have found the installation folder for trcsh hive installation.  The scripts folder contains a script that will create a set of plugins for use in trcsh hive technology.

# Prerequisites
This assumes the existence of a vault with tokens.  You'll need a root or unrestricted token to initialize data from here on out.  If you're a security purist, you'll already have deleted the root token at this point and will just operate with the unrestricted dev token for the steps below.
Agent *requires* trcsh to be set up prior to use.  Trcsh running on the server coordinates all activities within the agent.  In order to function, the additional feathering configurations must also be set up for each environment in which the agent operates.

# Next steps
