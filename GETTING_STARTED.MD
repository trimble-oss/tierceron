To set up tierceron secret and configuration management system you can do any of the following...

### Install command line tools
See [installation/README.md](installation/README.md)

### Setting up local vault (for new individuals or organizations without a vault set up yet)
See [installation/trclocal/README.md](installation/trclocal/README.md)

### Setting up a cloud hosted vault (skip if using local vault.  only for setting up in cloud -- needs cleanup)
See [installation/trccloud/terraform/azure/cloudboot/GETTING_STARTED.MD](installation/trccloud/terraform/azure/cloudboot/GETTING_STARTED.MD)

### Setting up default tokens and approles using example policy, role, and token configuration files (only needed to set up local or cloud instance of vault)
See [installation/trcvault/README.md](installation/trcvault/README.md)

### Setting up your very first hello world example application
See hello world section of [installation/trclocal/trchelloworld/README.md](installation/trclocal/trchelloworld/README.md)

### Installing collaborative deployment system (trcsh-curator and trcsh)
See [installation/trcshhive/trcsh-curator/README.md](installation/trcshhive/trcsh-curator/README.md)

### Installing TrcDb atrium for Tierceron Vault (OPTIONAL)
This section is if you would like to develop Tierceron trusted business flows utilizing the Tierceron flume package.  This usually requires extending tierceron to implement your own custom flow extensions.
